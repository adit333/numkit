# numkit

Numkit is a collection of numerical and machine learning algorithms.
Mainly used to improve my understanidng of black-box libraries like
scikit-learn, scipy and numpy. I want to implement the algorithms
in Python, C++ and Java or Kotlin.

The idea is for numkit to be a multi-language library,
so that I can use reuse the same algorithms in different
contexts. For example, have C++ support, so that I can use
it in compertitive programming, and have Python support,
so I can use it in my side-projests, and etc.

Another reason for having multiple language supprt is that
I can practice differnt languages, learn new things, and keep
my memory fresh.

Eventually, my roadmap is to have all numerical and scientific
algorithms implemnted in Python, C++, and Java; and have the
machine learning algorithms implemented in Python.
The reaon behind this is I tend to use numerical algortims
like Linear Programming in compertitive programming, for example,
and thus need a C++ implementation. But I only ever use Python with
machine lernaing.

TODO (before the end of the year):
* (HIGHEST PRIORITY: ASAP, can't proceed further before refactor)
    Convert ALL code to use OO pattern, very similar to scikit-learn.
    Design a intuitive and easy API across languages.
* Add missing unit tests
* Decision trees implementation for python
* Add more documentation
